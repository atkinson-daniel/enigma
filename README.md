# Enigma

### Self Evaluation

Functionality

```
**3: Meets Expectations**

My encrypt and decrypt methods works properly. The CL interfaces are successfully implemented.
```

Object Oriented Programming

```
**3: Meets Expectations**

I created two classes: one to create the shift values and another to do the encryption/decryption. I debated creating a key and date class, but decided that those functionalities should sit within the shift class.
```

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

```
**3: Meets Expectations**

The way I wrote my code follows proper Ruby convention. I broke my methods up to align with SRP and none of my methods are questionably long.
```

Test Driven Development

```
**3: Meets Expectations**

I used TDD throughout the design of this program. My test coverage is at 100% and I did test for edge cases, specifically if a message contained capitalized letters. I normalized the message to be downcase so it could be encrypted.
```

Version Control

```
**3: Meets Expectations**

I have over 30 commits and 10 pull requests. I used branching and provided concise comments on my pull requests.
